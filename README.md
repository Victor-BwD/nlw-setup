Some screenshoots:

Here we have the home screen, each square represents a day of the month. If the person completes a task that day, the square will change color, just like on Github itself.

Above we have a new task creation screen and the days you plan to perform it.

I completed a new task called "Run", so I marked it complete and the square changed to a darker purple. The lighter the color, the more tasks we complete in the day.

All the server part was done using Prisma, and the connection to the server was done using Axios.
